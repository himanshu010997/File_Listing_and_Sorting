# File_Listing_and_Sorting
A program to list 10 biggest files in a PC and moving Desktop files to a folder in Documents according to their extension

Download the Java file SortFiles.java. First of all make a copy of everything on desktop and put it in another place also just to be safe before testing the code Run the program  and enter the precise user name of the PC when it prompts for it, it will display the 10 biggest files in the given directory and also move files from desktop to folders in documents with names same as the extension of the files

The program takes too much dynamic memory so it may not work if the PC is too filled or it may take a while before it terminates. So, you can manually change the directory path (on line 99) to a smaller directory to check the functioning of program.
